# Database Design
Objective:
In this task, you will design a database for a Library Management System. You will create three 
diagrams: a conceptual model and logical model. The goal is to apply the principles of database 
design learned in class to a real-world scenario.
Scenario:
You have been hired to design a database for a library. The library needs to track books, 
members, loans, and publishers. The system should support the following functionalities:
1. Track Books: Store information about books, including title, author, ISBN, publisher, 
publication year, and genre.
2. Manage Members: Store information about members, including name, address, phone 
number, and email.
3. Track Loans: Track which books are borrowed by which members, along with the loan 
date and due date.
4. Manage Publishers: Store information about publishers, including name, address, and 
contact information.
5. Generate Reports: The system should be able to generate reports on overdue books, 
popular genres, and member activity.
Task Breakdown:
1. Conceptual Model (ER Diagram)
• Entities: Identify the major entities (e.g., Books, Members, Loans, Publishers).
• Relationships: Define the relationships between entities (e.g., a member can borrow 
multiple books, a book can have one publisher).
• Attributes: List the key attributes for each entity (e.g., Book attributes: Title, Author, 
ISBN).
• ER Diagram: Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to visually represent the entities 
and their relationships.
Deliverable: A conceptual model in the form of an ER diagram with entities, relationships, and 
attributes clearly labeled.
